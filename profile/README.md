## üöÄ What's New in Minecraft 1.21.94 APK?

Minecraft 1.21.94 is a robust update filled with exciting features, and we're going to break them down for you!

### **1. Tame and Ride the Happy Ghast** üêâüéÆ

One of the most exciting new features of **Minecraft 1.21.94 APK** is the addition of the **Happy Ghast**, a new flying mob that players can tame and ride. The Happy Ghast is a twist on the traditional Ghast, which is known for its fireball attacks and fearsome appearance. The Happy Ghast, however, is much friendlier and offers a new mode of transport in the Nether.

#### **How to Tame the Happy Ghast** üí°

Taming and riding a Happy Ghast is not an easy feat, and it requires you to gather several key items and follow specific steps:

1. **Find a Dried Ghast**: The first step in taming a Happy Ghast is to locate a Dried Ghast. These can be found in the Nether, and they serve as the precursor to the Happy Ghast.
2. **Transform the Dried Ghast**: After finding the Dried Ghast, you must pour **water** on it. This action transforms the Dried Ghast into a **Ghastling**, a mob that resembles a smaller Ghast.
3. **Feed the Ghastling Snowballs**: To grow the Ghastling into a full Happy Ghast, you need to feed it **snowballs**. This process can take a few rounds of feeding before the Ghastling reaches full size.
4. **Craft a Harness**: Once the Ghastling becomes a Happy Ghast, you can tame it by crafting a **Harness**. The Harness requires **leather**, **glass**, and **wool** to craft. This item allows you to ride the Happy Ghast.
5. **Ride and Control the Happy Ghast**: After crafting the Harness, you can place it on the Happy Ghast and mount it. The player who mounts the Ghast can control its flight, moving through the Nether skies. The cool part is that up to **four players** can ride the Happy Ghast at the same time!

The Happy Ghast adds a unique element to Minecraft's exploration mechanics, allowing players to fly through the dangerous Nether in style while also offering an entirely new experience for multiplayer sessions.
